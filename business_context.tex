The system focuses on simplifying the management of information related to train traveling and ticket payment for its users. The system will provide an account for each user which will store information regarding travel distance, destinations, payments, etc. This will help both users travelling by train and the companies providing the travelling services by keeping track of all these components in a centralized manner. 

The system will present the user with the choice of making an automated payment for each trip through the connection between the mobile app and the beacon in the train cart. Alternatively, an external payment system will be presented to the user I every train station where they can log in and perform the transaction. 

A second important target for our system will be represented by companies providing travelling services by train, which may include governmental institutions or different private companies.
