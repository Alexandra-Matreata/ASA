\section{Utility tree}
The output of the utility tree is a list of scenarios that serves as a plan
for the remainder of the ATAM evaluation. It shows the evaluation team
where the most important points are and where to examine the architectural
approaches and risks. The utility tree is composed of the key drivers of the
system, which in our case are security, reliability, and compatibility.
