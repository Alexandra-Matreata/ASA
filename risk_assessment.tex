      Poor response to the final product hence few people use it after spending money and time developing it & High, medium & Management, Architects & Poor response to the product due to unawareness or due to the final product, which customers find complicated to use & Project could be scrapped hence a waste of the funds put in it's development. & Advertise the product sufficiently to improve awareness and knowledge of the product, and ensure a sound architecture that is favourable for the users & Implement promotions for the users of the product to raise curiosity and interest \\ \hline
      Customer dissatisfaction  & Medium, medium & Architects, software developers & The final product is underwhelming and customers find it more difficult or the same as using the formal methods of payment & Little or no customers use the product hence, making it redundant & Develop a sound product to provide an easy payment option for it's customers &Attempt to improve the product at as low a cost as is possible before deciding to scrap it \\ \hline
      \multicolumn{7}{l}{\textit{Functionality}} \\ \hline
      User's phone battery dies before they have arrived at their final destination & High, High & Architect, Management & The continuous use of one's smart phone during a long journey in addition to the power used by the bluetooth to keep the connection to the beacons can lead to one's battery dying during the journey. & Mis-calculation of final travel fee & Make charging ports available in trains with this system or make the system available only in trains that have charging ports. & Message notification sent to user when battery is running out. \\ \hline

      The beacon connects to a phone of a user who has already used the conventional form of payment. & Medium, High & Architect & A beacon is trying to establish a connection with a user's smart phone, which has the account activated and yet the user has already paid for the journey. & System charges the user again leading to the user being inconvenienced & Notification sent to the user of an incoming connection to the service and an option of whether to accept the connection. & If user has notification feature switched off, they can access the application and cancel the journey stating that they have already paid, which can be confirmed by providing a ticket ID \\ \hline
      Hacker uses own beacon the try and access a user's phone. & High, medium & Architect, Developer & A hacker with a beacon similar to the ones in the train tries to connect to users' phones in order to receive the payments or other information. & User's private information on their device can be accessed and stolen & The train beacons and the phone application exchange keys generated by the system and the user's phone cannot be accessed without this key. & The application notifies the user that it cannot identify the beacon that is trying to connect to it. \\ \hline
      \multicolumn{7}{l}{\textit{Technology}} \\ \hline
      Low bluetooth range for a beacon & High, Medium & Architect & A user moves to a different train cart, which is out of range of the beacon it is connected to, which can lead a disconnection . & More than one beacon is used per cart in the train . & Another beacon closer to the user connects to their device. \\ \hline
